# Advent of Code in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges, implemented in **Go (Golang)**.

The purpose of this project is twofold:
- To improve my problem-solving skills through Advent of Code challenges.
- To learn and practice the Go programming language in a hands-on way.

Each folder contains the solution for a specific day, structured for readability and learning. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## Getting Started

To run a solution:

```bash
go run Day1-Part1/main.go
```

Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
